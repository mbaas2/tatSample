## tatSample

This is a small (but rapidly growing) library of scientific tools that you can use to simplify your APL-Code.
Instead of the infamous weird symbolic notation, benefit of a domain-specific language that makes you feel
at home immdiately and does not hurt eyes or brain.

## Demo

Where you had to write the arcane notation `1+1`  in old times, you can now relax and use  `1 plus 1` instead.
